Here is a chronology of the versions of Lua.
<A HREF="doc/hopl.pdf">The evolution of Lua</A>
is documented in a
<A HREF="docs.html#papers">paper</A>
presented at
<A HREF="http://research.ihost.com/hopl/HOPL.html">HOPL&nbsp;III,
the Third ACM SIGPLAN History of Programming Languages Conference</A>,
in 2007.
The source code and documentation for all releases is available for
<A HREF="ftp/">download</A>.

<H2><A NAME="numbering">Numbering scheme</A></H2>
<P>
The releases of Lua are numbered <EM>x.y.z</EM>,
where <EM>x.y</EM> is the version and <EM>z</EM> is the release.

<P>
Different releases for the same version correspond strictly to
<A HREF="bugs.html">bug fixes</A>;
there are no new features.
In particular,
different releases for the same version have the same
<A HREF="manual/">reference manual</A>,
the same virtual machine, and are binary compatible (ABI compatible).

<P>
Different versions are really different.
The API is likely to be a little different
(but with compatibility switches),
and there is no ABI compatibility:
applications that embed Lua and C&nbsp;libraries for Lua must be recompiled.
The virtual machine is also very likely to be different in a new version:
Lua programs that have been precompiled for one version will not load in a different version.

metatables instead of tags and tag methods.
Lua 5.0 also introduces
booleans,
proper tail calls,
and weak tables.
Other features are
better support for packages,
new API for loading Lua chunks,
new error handling protocol,
better error messages,
and much more.
Lua 5.0 was the first version to be released under the
<A HREF="license.html">new license</A>.

<P>

Its main new features were
multiples states,

all functions in the standard library are written using the official API.

<H2><A NAME="3.1">Lua 3.1</A></H2>
<P>
<A HREF="ftp/lua-3.1.tar.gz">Lua 3.1</A>
was released on 11 Jul 1998.
Its main new features were
anonymous functions and
function closures via "upvalues".
(Lua 5.0 brought full lexical scoping and dropped upvalues.)
This brought a flavor of functional programming to Lua.
There was also support for multiple global contexts;
however, the API was not fully reentrant
(this had to wait until Lua 4.0).
Lua 3.1 also saw a
major code re-organization and clean-up,
with much reduced module interdependencies.
Lua 3.1 also adopted double precision for the internal representation of numbers.

Its main new feature was
tag methods as a powerful replacement for fallbacks.

a library for helping writing Lua libraries,
and support for conditional compilation
(dropped in Lua 4.0).
